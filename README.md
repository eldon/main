# Notion Todos Printer

This is a simple app that fetches my todos from today's kanban board in Notion and prints their titles on a receipt using a ZJ58 thermal printer.

You'll have to rename `notion_config.example.yaml` to `notion_config.yaml` with your notion's info.

This software comes with no license and no warranty. Use it at your own risk. It probably won't work!
